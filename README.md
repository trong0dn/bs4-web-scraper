# web-scraper
A simple web scraper using Python3 with BeautifulSoup4 library to extract the latest feed of products from the Newegg website.  The resulting output was then written to a csv file. Long story made short, recently built a PC and looking for GPUs on the market. Thought it would be fun to web scrape some potential websites for comparing overall cost of the product.

## Dependencies
[BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) - Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files

## Installation

To get started, we need to download Python package manager.

```
// Windows Environment
> python get-pip.py
```

```
// Ubuntu-Linux Environment
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

### Installing BeautifulSoup

As BeautifulSoup is not a standard library, we need to install it. We are going to use the BeautifulSoup 4 package (known as bs4).

```
// Window Environment
> pip install beautifulsoup4
```

```
// Ubuntu-Linux Environment
$ sudo apt-get install python3-bs4
```

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to my gaming friends for giving me the "push" to look for GPUs.
